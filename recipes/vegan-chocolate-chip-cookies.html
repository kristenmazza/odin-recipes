        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup refined coconut oil</li>
            <li>3/4 cup organic granulated sugar</li>
            <ii>3/4 cup packed organic brown sugar</ii>
            <li>1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <ii>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</ii>
            <li>1 1/4 cups vegan chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the coconut oil, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Using a hand mixer (or a whisk) cream the oil and sugars together until fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add in the applesauce and vanilla, and mix well.
            <li>Stir in the all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until a dough forms. Lastly, fold in chocolate chips until well incorporated.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Keep in mind that this recipe makes 3 dozen so you will need to bake multiple batches.</li>
            <li>Using a 1 tablespoon-sized scooper, drop mounds of dough onto the baking sheet 2 inches apart (we fit 12 on each sheet and baked these in 3 batches). No need to press them down.</li>
            <li>Place into the oven and bake for 13-14 minutes, or until the edges brown. The cookies will seem soft but don’t worry, they will firm up while they cool. Allow the cookies to rest on the baking sheet for 1 minute after removing them from the oven and then carefully transfer them onto a cooling rack using a spatula.</li>
            <li>Cool and set and then dig in!</li>
        </ol>
